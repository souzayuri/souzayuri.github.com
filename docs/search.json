I\r\nhave been exploring different research topics since the beginning of my\r\ncareer, ranging from modeling plants to fieldwork and mammal surveys.\r\nMost of my research has focused on understanding how populations,\r\ncommunities, and ecosystems respond to human disturbances from different\r\nperspectives. So, I am interested in comprehending the Anthropocene’s\r\nconsequences on organisms and environmental maintenance.\r\nAcademic Background\r\nPresent\r\n\r\n\r\n\r\n",
