## **Abstract**
Campos de Murundus, or earthmounds, are discrete mounds surrounded by grass common throughout the Brazilian Savanna. Such sites favor colonization by plants and by termitesÂ¹, which play a significant role in ecosystem dynamics and maintenance through organic matter decomposition and gas fluxes. I aim to address how Campos de murundus drives ecosystem dynamics in a spatial gradient. For this, we will perform a literature review and data collection in the Brazilian Savanna Cerrado. We hypothesize the existence of a gradient of termite diversity, soil nutrient enrichment, plant functional composition, and gas fluxes increasing from an open grass field of the Savanna to the Murundus.
